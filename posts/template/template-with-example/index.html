    <p> When you think back on 2023, how will you remember it?</br></br>

For me, this will always be the year I became a grandparent. It will be the year I spent a lot of precious time with loved ones—whether on the pickleball court or over a rousing game of Settlers of Catan. And 2023 marked the first time I used artificial intelligence for work and other serious reasons, not just to mess around and create parody song lyrics for my friends.</br></br>

This year gave us a glimpse of how AI will shape the future, and as 2023 comes to a close, I’m thinking more than ever about the world today’s young people will inherit. In last year’s letter, I wrote about how the prospect of becoming a grandparent made me reflect on the world my granddaughter will be born into. Now I’m thinking more about the world she will inherit and what it will be like decades from now, when her generation is in charge.</br></br>

I can begin to picture it: the tools she will use, the ways she will stay in touch with her loved ones, the problems these innovations will help solve. We now have a better sense of what types of jobs AI will be able to do by itself and which ones it will serve as a copilot for. And it’s clearer than ever how AI can be used to improve access to education, mental health, and more. It motivates me to make sure this technology helps reduce—and doesn’t contribute to—the awful inequities we see around the world. I've always been a firm believer in the power of innovation to offer every child an equal chance to survive and thrive. AI is no exception.</br></br>

The early years of a new age are often marked by lots of changes. If you are old enough to remember, think back to the beginning of the internet. At first, you probably didn’t know many people who were using it. But it became more common over time until, one day, you realized most people had email addresses, bought things online, and used search engines to answer their questions.</br></br>

We are just at the beginning of this transition right now. This is an exciting and confusing time, and if you haven’t figured out how to make the best use of AI yet, you are not alone. I thought I would use AI tools for the foundation’s strategy reviews this year, which require reading hundreds of pages of briefing materials that an AI could accurately summarize for me. But old habits are hard to break, and I ended up preparing for them the same way I always do.</br></br>

Of course, AI is far from the only defining feature of 2023. Millions continue to experience unbearable grief as a result of Russia’s war on Ukraine and in the aftermath of the war in Ethiopia. My heart is broken for the continued suffering of Israelis and Palestinians, as well as for the people of Sudan. At the same time, more people are being forced to endure hardship as a result of more frequent extreme weather events caused by climate change. And families around the world continue to be hit hard by rising inflation and slow economic growth.</br></br>

There’s no question these are challenging times, but I remain optimistic about the future. The speed of innovation has never been faster. We’re making big strides on tough problems—like Alzheimer’s, obesity, and sickle cell disease—that will improve the lives of millions of people. My friend the late Hans Rosling used to say that “things can be bad and getting better.” It’s a good reminder that progress is not only possible but happening every day.</br></br>

That’s why I remain dedicated to making sure that, even in the face of setbacks, the world continues to do more to help the poorest people. I do the bulk of this work through the Gates Foundation, where my colleagues remain dedicated to improving global health, education, gender equality, and more. While I could write a thousand pages about the incredible work they’re doing with our partners, this letter focuses on just a few of the most exciting breakthroughs.</br></br>

I also write about why I’m optimistic about the world’s climate progress. Most of my climate and energy work is done through Breakthrough Energy, although the Gates Foundation is helping people in low- and middle-income countries adapt to a warming world. I also continue to privately fund research into other areas like Alzheimer’s disease. And I still get to advise Microsoft, which gives me insight into what’s coming down the pipeline and how it can be used to make the world a more equitable place.</br></br>

I’m lucky that my work gives me insight into all the ways the world is getting better. The challenges we face feel a lot less daunting when you understand what exactly it will take to tackle them. In this letter, I will share just a few reasons I am optimistic about the year ahead. I hope they make you as excited about all the progress to come as I am.</br>

<h3><strong>AI is about to supercharge the innovation pipeline.</strong></h3>
My work has always been rooted in a core idea: Innovation is the key to progress. It’s why I started Microsoft, and it’s why Melinda and I started the Gates Foundation more than two decades ago.</br></br>

Innovation is the reason our lives have improved so much over the last century. From electricity and cars to medicine and planes, innovation has made the world better. Today, we are far more productive because of the IT revolution. The most successful economies are driven by innovative industries that evolve to meet the needs of a changing world.</br></br>

My favorite innovation story, though, starts with one of my favorite statistics: Since 2000, the world has cut in half the number of children who die before the age of five.</br></br>

How did we do it? One key reason was innovation. Scientists came up with new ways to make vaccines that were faster and cheaper but just as safe. They developed new delivery mechanisms that worked in the world’s most remote places, which made it possible to reach more kids. And they created new vaccines that protect children from deadly diseases like rotavirus.</br></br>

</div>

In a world with limited resources, you have to find ways to maximize impact. Innovation is the key to getting the most out of every dollar spent. And artificial intelligence is about to accelerate the rate of new discoveries at a pace we’ve never seen before.</br></br>

One of the biggest impacts so far is on creating new medicines. Drug discovery requires combing through massive amounts of data, and AI tools can speed up that process significantly. Some companies are already working on cancer drugs developed this way. But a key priority of the Gates Foundation in AI is ensuring these tools also address health issues that disproportionately affect the world's poorest, like AIDS, TB, and malaria.</br></br>

We’re taking a hard look at the wide array of AI innovation in the pipeline right now and working with our partners to use these technologies to improve lives in low- and middle-income countries.</br></br>

In the fall, I traveled to Senegal to meet with some of the incredible researchers doing this work and to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the foundation’s Grand Challenges initiative. When we first launched Grand Challenges—the Gates Foundation’s flagship innovation program—it had a single goal: Identify the biggest problems in health and give grants to local researchers who might solve them. We asked innovators from developing countries how they would address health challenges in their communities, and then we gave them the support to make it happen.</br></br>

Many of the people I met in Senegal were taking on the first-ever AI Grand Challenge. The foundation didn’t have AI projects in mind when we first set that goal back in 2003, but I’m always inspired by how brilliant scientists are able to take advantage of the latest technology to tackle big problems.</br></br>

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
    $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{\texttip{b^2-4ac}{descriminant}} \over 2a \nonumber}.$$

Here is a labeled equation:
$$x+1\over\sqrt{1-x^2}\label{ref1}$$
with a reference to ref1: \ref{ref1},
and another numbered one with no label:
$$x+1\over\sqrt{1-x^2}$$
This one uses \nonumber:
$$x+1\over\sqrt{1-x^2}\nonumber$$

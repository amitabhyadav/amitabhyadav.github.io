When I was twelve, I used to tell my father, "When I grow up, I want to become a Scientist". Back
then, it was a figment of my imaginative mind that was too young to understand career or future
goals. In school, the subjects Mathematics and Computer Science were my favourite. Computer
Programming came naturally to me, and I felt I could visualise the problem statements as
mathematical equations. I understood computer architecture. But, I wanted to go deeper into the roots
of Computer Engineering and study Processor Architecture. Electronics Engineering, for me was the
perfect blend of hardware and software aspects of a computer system. Choosing a branch of study,
therefore, was not difficult for me. </br> </br>
When I started at University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES), I was very curious about'research' 
and my initial interaction with my professors and seniors gave me a glimpse of just how
vast and diverse the applications of electronics are! I developed my interest through reading research
publications and articles from IEEE. In class, I would study Control System, Electronic Devices and
Circuits, VLSI Design and Technology; and simultaneously self-studied Algorithms, Data Structures
and Automata Theory. </br></br>
My first major breakthrough came with active participation in the CanSat Competition 2015 at Texas,
USA hosted by NASA. We outperformed many renowned international universities and I was
appointed as the Team Lead of ten students for CanSat 2016, where we aced in all of Europe and
Asia. Business Insider (July 19, 2016) wrote about us, "Indian students presented an Epic CanSat
System at Global Aerospace Competition in Texas, and it left NASA absolutely stunned". That year, I
was introduced to an even bigger project. US Defence giant, Lockheed Martin, had approached the
University for a Fifteen-Member Team to design a payload for the famed C-130J Super Hercules
Military Aircraft. All major Indian Defence organizations were involved and I was given the
opportunity to be a part of the Engineering Team. Alongside our studies, we worked on this project
for months – day and night. As a result, the project was a national success! I still continue to
contribute to the team, as a team member. </br></br>
Looking back, I find that I had greater satisfaction in coding software and implementing digital
designs on FPGA. My curiosity over high-performance mission-critical processing systems reached a
level that in my third year, I applied and got selected for Research Internship at Bhabha Atomic
Research Centre (BARC), India‟s prime Nuclear Research facility in Mumbai, which I now believe
was the most resourceful summer of my life! Under guidance of Mr S K Lalwani, Head of Data
Acquisition and Processing Systems (DA&PS) Section, I worked on Ultrasonic NDT of materials. I
developed a software using MATLAB to test algorithms based on Information Theory, DCT, DFT
and Wavelet Transforms for "Ultrasonic-Data Compression"; and tested various codes on Altera
FPGA. BARC taught me the most advanced topics but also showed a clear picture that all advanced
engineering originates from the basics. I was recognised among the top ten researchers of UPES
(Bachelors and Masters) – Rank 8th – in 2015, and it was this research on Wireless Sensor Networks
that I published my first research paper and filed my first patent. </br></br>
Academics apart, I have had an immensely enriching college life. I have had the pleasure of serving as
the "Discipline Committee Head" of our University and the "IT and Design Head" of the UPES – IEEE
Student Chapter. Living in the Lower Himalayas, I've fallen in love with nature, enjoying the lush
greenery and reading stories of Ruskin Bond. Sometimes, while applying to esteemed Universities
such as TU Delft, I am countered by the notion that my grades seldom reflect me as an 'Outstanding'
student. But, grades don't satisfy my appetite for knowledge. Nevertheless, ever since school days, I
have always maintained my rank in the top 10 of the class. </br></br>
Choosing a Major Project for final year was not difficult. My final year project is "Design and FPGA
Implementation of 16-bit Microcontroller using VHDL", which I'm happy to say brought great
appreciation from the Faculty. I started with learning VHDL to its depths and revising concepts of
Digital Design. To dive further in, I approached my project guide, Dr Adesh Kumar, for his guidance.
He instructed me to refer the books Digital Systems Design Using VHDL: Jr. Charles H. Roth, Lizy
K. John and VHDL Programming by Example: Douglas L. Perry. It was an excellent introduction to
State Machine design and working of digital circuits such as DRAM and UART. I have designed and
tested 16-bit ALU, Comparator, Traffic light Controller and am currently working on 2^16 × 8 SRAM.
Designing sequential circuits and implementing Parallel-In-Parallel-Out method is a challenge. I have
to deal with timing synchronisations, latching address and data bus, implementing multiplexing for
read-write operations etc. I am also working on design of UART and studying integration of the units.
In the semester break, I plan to further strengthen my concepts of Processor Architecture, and once
back, start working extensively on the system. I use Xilinx ISE 14.2 and ModelSim 10.0 for chip
design. I look forward to testing the complete system on Spartan-6 and Virtex V5 FPGA. I will be
devoting these final two semesters in doing so which carries 4+8 credits. </br></br>
My fourth year is drawing to an end and I have started putting in efforts to contact each University.
Given my zest for research, I was strongly advised by my project guide, Dr Ugur Guven to pursue
higher studies in Europe, TU Delft being his first recommendation. Coincidently, I had the
opportunity to attend a lecture at our university by Dr Pieter Jonker of TU Delft, the very same year.
TU Delft gave me a chance to study Multi-Core Processors, Computation-In-Memory, Liquid
Architectures and Quantum Computing, an exposure that no other University could provide. I look at
the online course structure of TU Delft and realize that this is just what I need to eventually fulfil my
dream. Look, for example at two of the subjects, Advanced Computing Systems and Reconfigurable
Computing Design. Wouldn't that be a research that will define the next generation of computing
devices? I feel the desire to learn how to design complex computing platforms, define Architectures
and Instruction Sets for processors and ASICs. I look towards using my experience in digital system
design and my ability in handling super intense pressure to design mission-critical adaptive processing
systems – that blends high speed, low power and precise timing. Factually, TU Delft is a decade
ahead of UPES. And that is what excites me. I look at TU Delft graduates working at Google, Intel &
NVIDIA as Design Engineers and feel a connection I can‟t establish, an inspiration that spurs me on
towards my 'ultimate goal'. </br></br>
I enjoy the learning process and is the reason I wish to pursue master‟s study in Computer
Engineering with specialisation in Liquid Architectures. Being part of this next generation community
of Computer Scientists has been my desire. I see reconfigurable computing as a unique platform to
optimise processors into adaptable computing devices. Browsing through various topics of M.Sc.
research at EEMCS Department website an idea for my M.Sc. thesis stroke my mind – "Design of
Parallel and Scalable Processor Architectures in Scientific Micro-Satellites". Micro-satellites need to
be developed with ever-increasing need to handle more data, thus, this project aims at more datahandling
and processing capability by developing and testing parameterised processors on FPGA.
Reading on research by Prof. Koen Bertels, I also considered, as a hypothetical project idea,
combining the specialisations of Liquid Architecture and Quantum Computing; such as "Design of
digital reconfigurable processor in Quantum-Dot Cellular Automata (QCA)".
I have many aspirations and ambitions to achieve both within Computer Engineering and beyond. But
right now, I am willing to come all the way to The Netherlands and pursue M.Sc. in Computer
Engineering at Delft University of Technology. Thus, I pen down my Letter of Motivation with due
reverence to the University and the Department. </br></br>
